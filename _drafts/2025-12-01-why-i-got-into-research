I grew up with a moderately severe hearing impairment (~50dB loss) in both ears, though I didn't discover it until I was eight years old. At the time, the government subsidized a hearing aid for my right ear, but I was too embarrassed to wear it throughout primary and high school. As a result of this insecurity, I always failed the listening section of my English exams.

When I entered university, I finally decided to wear my hearing aid and meet new people. While it certainly helped me communicate better, I still struggled to have smooth conversations in English with foreigners. This frustration bothered me deeply—until an accident changed everything.

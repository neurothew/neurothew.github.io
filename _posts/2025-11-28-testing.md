This is the first post on my new blog! Here, I'll be sharing thoughts and updates on my research, interests, and other musings.

The text you're reading right now is the "excerpt." It will show up on the main blog page. Anything after the special `<!--more-->` tag will only appear when a visitor clicks to read the full post.

<!--more-->

Here is the rest of the content for the blog post. It's hidden from the main blog page but visible here on the post's own page. You can write as much as you want here.

You can include:
*   Lists
*   **Bold text**
*   `code snippets`

And anything else you can write in Markdown.

TLDR: Exploring how cortical tracking of acoustic, subsyllabic segmentation and subsyllabic phonotactic features is modulated by degree of subjective cognitive decline.

Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) approximately doubles the risk of progressing to MCI and dementia. The present study investigates how one's subjective concerns of his/her own cognition are manifested in the neural dynamics during speech perception. EEG was collected from 56 Cantonese, cognitively normal older adults (aged 60 - 70) while they listened to stimuli of four expressive styles that varied in prosody: scrambled, descriptive, dialogue, and exciting. Using encoding models to predict EEG signals from acoustic, segmentation, and phonotactic features, we found that greater subjective concern was associated with weaker cortical tracking of (1) higher-level linguistic features but not acoustic features and (2) less engaging stimuli (scrambled and descriptive styles) but not prosodically rich stimuli. Overall, our results suggest that early signs of cognitive impairment can be revealed from speech perception via cortical tracking, especially while listening to prosodically flat speech.

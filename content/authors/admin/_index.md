# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am now working with Prof. William Shiyuan Wang as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies in Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am interested in investigating the cognitive neuroscience of ageing and speech perception with electroencephalography (EEG). During my doctoral study, I focused on the age-related changes in the resting-state brain signals recorded with EEG. I have also initiated a rehabilitation project for cancer patients who had their vocal cords removed, leading to the development of a mobile app that synthesizes their pre-surgery voice. Recently, I am using EEG to study brain activity in older adults as they listen to speech or music, aiming to deepen the understanding of how aging and subjective cognitive decline affect cognitive functions.

# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am currently working as a postdoctoral fellow in the research center of language, cognition and neuroscience in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am interested in studying the healthy/pathological ageing brains, especially from the resting-state perspective. I believe that the functional architecture of each individual is hidden in the resting-state activities. Apart from resting-state, I am also investigating the possibility in detecting changes in cognitive abilities in older adults using passive speech perception tasks.

abstract: Clustering and switching are hypothesised to reflect the automatic and controlled
  components in category fluency, respectively, but how they are associated with cognitive
  functions has not been fully elucidated, due to several uncertainties. (1) The conventional
  scoring method that segregates responses by semantic categories could not optimally
  dissociate the automatic and controlled components. (2) The temporal structure of
  individual responses, as characterised by mean retrieval time (MRT) and mean switching
  time (MST), has seldom been analysed alongside the more well-studied variables,
  cluster size (CS) and number of switches (NS). (3) Most studies examined only one
  to a few semantic categories, raising concerns of generalisability. This study built
  upon a distance-based automatic clustering procedure, referred to as temporal-semantic
  distance procedure, to thoroughly characterise the category fluency performance.
  Linear mixed-effects (LME) modelling was applied to re-examine the differential
  associations of clustering and switching with cognitive functions with a sample
  of 80 university students. Our results revealed that although lexical retrieval
  speed (LRS) is clearly the determining factor for effective clustering and switching,
  matrix reasoning and processing speed also have significant roles to play, possibly
  in the processes of identifying and validating the semantic relationships. Interestingly,
  total fluency score was accurately predicted by the four clustering/switching indices
  alone; including the cognitive variables did not significantly improve the prediction.
  These findings underline the importance of the clustering and switching indices
  in explaining the category fluency performance and the cognitive demands in category
  fluency.

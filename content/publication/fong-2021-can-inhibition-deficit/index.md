abstract: The inhibition deficit hypothesis (IDH) proposed that individual differences
  in inhibitory control is an underlying reason for age-related language decline.
  This study examined whether the hypothesis holds within the domain of lexico-semantic
  retrieval. Sixty-six older adults aged 60-79 were tested in a semantic fluency task
  comprising 16 categories; each response was classified as automatic or controlled.
  Also, Stroop color and word test and an ERP flanker task were employed to yield
  both behavioral and neural measures of inhibitory control. Mixed-effects modelling
  revealed that the number of controlled (but not automatic) responses was negatively
  associated with age. This interaction could be partially accounted for by the behavioral
  Stroop inhibition score and two neural measures from the ERP flanker task (P2 and
  Pc amplitudes). These results not only provide converging evidence supporting the
  IDH, but also demonstrate the involvement of specific inhibitory control components,
  including attentional control and performance monitoring.

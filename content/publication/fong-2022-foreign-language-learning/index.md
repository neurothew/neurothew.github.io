abstract: In recent years, foreign language learning (FLL) has been proposed as a
  possible cognitive intervention for older adults. However, the brain network and
  cognitive functions underlying FLL has remained largely unconfirmed in older adults.
  In particular, older and younger adults have markedly different cognitive profile-while
  older adults tend to exhibit decline in most cognitive domains, their semantic memory
  usually remains intact. As such, older adults may engage the semantic functions
  to a larger extent than the other cognitive functions traditionally considered the
  most important (e.g., working memory capacity and phonological awareness). Using
  anatomical measurements and a cognitive test battery, the present study examined
  this hypothesis in twenty cognitively normal older adults (58-69 years old), who
  participated in a two-month Italian learning programme. Results showed that the
  immediate learning success and long-term retention of Italian vocabularies were
  most consistently predicted by the anatomical measures of the left pars orbitalis
  and left caudal middle frontal cortex, which are implicated in semantic and episodic
  memory functions. Convergent evidence was also found based on the pattern of cognitive
  associations. Our results are consistent with a prominent role of semantic and episodic
  memory functions in vocabulary learning in older learners.

abstract: This paper reports results from a free labeling experiment employing short
  audio-visual utterances of Cantonese produced with varying attitudinal expressions.
  It is part of a series of such experiments with a cross-language setting between
  German and Cantonese. Cantonese-speaking perceivers were asked to specify a single
  word that best described these stimuli, which were presented in audio-visual, audio-only,
  and video-only modalities. The resulting terms were analyzed with respect to the
  emotional dimensions of valence, activation and dominance, as well as the linguistic
  dimension of assertion/interrogation. The analysis results are compared with the
  outcomes from similar experiments employing German stimuli with Cantonese perceivers,
  as well as German perceivers assessing both German and Cantonese stimuli. It is
  found that Cantonese perceivers judge the Cantonese stimuli as more activated than
  German perceives do. The valence judgments agree relatively well, however, ``polite''
  stimuli were judged less positively by Cantonese perceivers. Generally speaking,
  valence judgments are mostly influenced by the stimuli whereas activation and dominance
  judgments depend more on the perceiver group.

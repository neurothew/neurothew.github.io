abstract: The loss of complexity in ageing hypothesis (LOCH) has found support from
  EEG studies, most of which adopted signal-domain complexity measures. The present
  study adopted the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) to measure complexity from a nonlinear
  dynamical systems perspective. A total of 144 participants were included and divided
  into young, young-old and old-old groups. Both sensor-space and source-space results
  showed significantly lower LLE for older than younger adults. The age-related differences
  were region-dependent, being most prominent in the frontal region, followed by bilateral
  temporal regions. The occipital region showed non-significant differences. Significant
  reduction of LLE in the posterior cingulate was also observed by virtue of the source-space
  analysis. We also evaluated the relationships between LLE and other complexity measures.
  The most intriguing result was the negative correlation between LLE and Lempel-Ziv
  complexity (LZC). The age-related decrease in LLE indicated a higher regularity
  in dynamics, while the higher LZC indicated a higher randomness in the signal domain.
  The new findings support the LOCH by demonstrating the simultaneous increase in
  regularity and randomness.

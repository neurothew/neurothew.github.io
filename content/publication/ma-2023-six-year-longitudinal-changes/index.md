abstract: This paper aims to introduce a longitudinal resting-state electroencephalography
  (EEG) dataset contributed by a healthy older individual who aged from 82.6 to 89.3.
  The dataset consists of 188 sessions of restingstate eyes-open and eyes-closed recording,
  taken largely on a weekly basis spanning over six years, albeit with a two-year
  gap in the midst. Preliminary analyses were done to investigate the age-related
  changes of conventional spectral characteristics including absolute and relative
  band power. The results were also compared to a group of older individuals. Through
  the longitudinal data, we found increased delta, theta, and alpha absolute power
  with advancing age, with little changes in the higher frequency oscillatory power.
  Interestingly, these changes in absolute power might indirectly lead to the changes
  in relative power in other bands (e.g., gamma). Such relationships cannot be derived
  from the group-level data. Lastly, the individual- and grouplevel data showed opposite
  findings, suggesting a possibility that the spectral features exhibit nonlinear
  trajectories in the older age range

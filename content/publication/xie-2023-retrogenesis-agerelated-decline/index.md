abstract: $<$p$>$The retrogenesis hypothesis proposes that the order of breakdown
  of cognitive abilities in older adults is the reverse of the developmental order
  of children. Declarative and procedural memory systems, however, have been empirically
  understudied regarding this issue. The current study aimed to investigate whether
  retrogenesis occurs in the developmental and decline order of the declarative and
  procedural memory systems. Besides, we further investigated whether retrogenesis
  occurs in declarative memory, which was tested through the recognition of familiar
  and unfamiliar items. Both questions were investigated by looking at 28 Chinese
  younger adults and 27 cognitively healthy Chinese older adults. The recognition
  memory task and the Serial Reaction Time Task were administered on two consecutive
  days in order to measure their declarative and procedural memory, respectively.
  The results showed older adults performed significantly worse than younger adults
  for both tasks on both days, suggesting a decline in both declarative and procedural
  memory. Moreover, older adults exhibited relatively preserved declarative memory
  compared to procedural memory. This does not follow the expectations of the retrogenesis
  hypothesis. However, older adults demonstrated superior performance and a steeper
  rate of forgetting for recognizing familiar items than unfamiliar items. This reverses
  the developmental order of different patterns in the declarative memory system.
  Overall, we conclude that retrogenesis occurs in the declarative memory system,
  while does not in the decline order of the two memory systems; this understanding
  can better help inform our broader understanding of memory aging.$<$/p$>$

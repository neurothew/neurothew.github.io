<p>
Hi, I am Matthew, currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Research Centre for Language, Cognition and Neuroscience, Department of Language Science and Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPolyU).
</p>

<p>
My research primarily focuses on the cognitive neuroscience of aging and speech perception, utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) to explore how these processes unfold in the brain. Recently I have been particularly interested in studying the cortical tracking of speech and music, and how these neural mechanisms are altered in aging populations and individuals with subjective cognitive decline. Parallel to this, I am also keenly interested in large language models, particularly in deciphering their inner working mechanisms through a linguistic lens, and leveraging them to study brain activity – an interesting area known as model-brain alignment.
</p>

<p>
Before joining HKPolyU, I completed my PhD at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) under the supervision of Prof. Tan LEE.

<p>
In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and photography.

Hi, I am Matthew, currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Research Centre for Language, Cognition and Neuroscience, Department of Language Science and Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPolyU).
</p>

<p>
Born with moderately severe hearing loss, I fortunately grew up integrating pretty well into the hearing environment (I suppose), accompanied by a curiosity about speech perception. Hoping to contribute to the development of hearing assistive technology, I studied biomedical engineering as an undergraduate.
</p>

<p>
Soon I realized that to advance hearing assistive technology, having a better understanding of the neural mechanisms of speech perception was essential. As such, I began my PhD investigating brain dynamics via electroencephalography (EEG). My doctoral dissertation involved the characterization of the resting brain in ageing, bridging digital signal processing and neuroscience.
</p>

<p>
While my dissertation focused on the resting-state, I have always wanted to know more about how our ongoing brain oscillations facilitate the binding of acoustic and linguistic units into comprehensible sentences and paragraphs. This led me to apply for several grants, including the HKRGC Postdoctoral Fellowship, to study speech perception via the cortical tracking phenomenon. Ultimately, I would like to understand how different levels of linguistic information are processed and integrated, and how these mechanisms are affected by ageing and cognitive decline.
</p>

<p>
Relatively recently, the human-level linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs) has drawn my interest. By manipulating and experimenting on LLM components and architectures, I aim to use LLMs as a tool to model human behavioural as well as neurophysiological responses. The two black boxes, the brain and the LLMs, can be complementary, and we can use one to help study the other.
</p>

<p>
In my spare time, I enjoy strolling, hiking and <a href="gallery">taking photos</a>, or just sleeping (doing research is exhausting, isn't it?).

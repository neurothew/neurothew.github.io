  abstract = {Clustering and switching are hypothesised to reflect the automatic and controlled components in category fluency, respectively, but how they are associated with cognitive functions has not been fully elucidated, due to several uncertainties. (1) The conventional scoring method that segregates responses by semantic categories could not optimally dissociate the automatic and controlled components. (2) The temporal structure of individual responses, as characterised by mean retrieval time (MRT) and mean switching time (MST), has seldom been analysed alongside the more well-studied variables, cluster size (CS) and number of switches (NS). (3) Most studies examined only one to a few semantic categories, raising concerns of generalisability. This study built upon a distance-based automatic clustering procedure, referred to as temporal-semantic distance procedure, to thoroughly characterise the category fluency performance. Linear mixed-effects (LME) modelling was applied to re-examine the differential associations of clustering and switching with cognitive functions with a sample of 80 university students. Our results revealed that although lexical retrieval speed (LRS) is clearly the determining factor for effective clustering and switching, matrix reasoning and processing speed also have significant roles to play, possibly in the processes of identifying and validating the semantic relationships. Interestingly, total fluency score was accurately predicted by the four clustering/switching indices alone; including the cognitive variables did not significantly improve the prediction. These findings underline the importance of the clustering and switching indices in explaining the category fluency performance and the cognitive demands in category fluency.},

This study examined whether the hypothesis holds within the domain of lexico-semantic retrieval. Sixty-six older adults aged 60-79 were tested in a semantic fluency task comprising 16 categories; each response was classified as automatic or controlled. Also, Stroop color and word test and an ERP flanker task were employed to yield both behavioral and neural measures of inhibitory control. Mixed-effects modelling revealed that the number of controlled (but not automatic) responses was negatively associated with age. This interaction could be partially accounted for by the behavioral Stroop inhibition score and two neural measures from the ERP flanker task (P2 and Pc amplitudes). These results not only provide converging evidence supporting the IDH, but also demonstrate the involvement of specific inhibitory control components, including attentional control and performance monitoring.},

  abstract = {In recent years, foreign language learning (FLL) has been proposed as a possible cognitive intervention for older adults. However, the brain network and cognitive functions underlying FLL has remained largely unconfirmed in older adults. In particular, older and younger adults have markedly different cognitive profile-while older adults tend to exhibit decline in most cognitive domains, their semantic memory usually remains intact. As such, older adults may engage the semantic functions to a larger extent than the other cognitive functions traditionally considered the most important (e.g., working memory capacity and phonological awareness). Using anatomical measurements and a cognitive test battery, the present study examined this hypothesis in twenty cognitively normal older adults (58-69 years old), who participated in a two-month Italian learning programme. Results showed that the immediate learning success and long-term retention of Italian vocabularies were most consistently predicted by the anatomical measures of the left pars orbitalis and left caudal middle frontal cortex, which are implicated in semantic and episodic memory functions. Convergent evidence was also found based on the pattern of cognitive associations. Our results are consistent with a prominent role of semantic and episodic memory functions in vocabulary learning in older learners.},

It is part of a series of such experiments with a cross-language setting between German and Cantonese. Cantonese-speaking perceivers were asked to specify a single word that best described these stimuli, which were presented in audio-visual, audio-only, and video-only modalities. The resulting terms were analyzed with respect to the emotional dimensions of valence, activation and dominance, as well as the linguistic dimension of assertion/interrogation. The analysis results are compared with the outcomes from similar experiments employing German stimuli with Cantonese perceivers, as well as German perceivers assessing both German and Cantonese stimuli. It is found that Cantonese perceivers judge the Cantonese stimuli as more activated than German perceives do. The valence judgments agree relatively well, however, ``polite'' stimuli were judged less positively by Cantonese perceivers. Generally speaking, valence judgments are mostly influenced by the stimuli whereas activation and dominance judgments depend more on the perceiver group.},

  abstract = {EEG-based biometrics has gained great attention in recent years due to its superiority over traditional biometrics in terms of its resistance to circumvention. While there are numerous choices of data acquisition protocol, the present study is carried out with the least demanding resting-state condition. Motivated by neurophysiological knowledge, a type of novel feature, namely the intrinsic mode correlation (IMCOR), is proposed. It is designed by combining the nonstationary multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) and the concept of brain connectivity. With machine learning classifiers, our system yields promising performance in a 81-class classification (F1 score: 0.99) within a single session. For 32-class cross-session classification, an F1 score of 0.55 is attained. The results suggest that the proposed method might be vulnerable to temporal effects and between-session variability. This study highlights the uniqueness of the proposed non-stationary and connectivity-based feature and demonstrated its success as a biometrics. Further investigation is needed to make the method practically useful.},

A total of 144 participants were included and divided into young, young-old and old-old groups. Both sensor-space and source-space results showed significantly lower LLE for older than younger adults. The age-related differences were region-dependent, being most prominent in the frontal region, followed by bilateral temporal regions. The occipital region showed non-significant differences. Significant reduction of LLE in the posterior cingulate was also observed by virtue of the source-space analysis. We also evaluated the relationships between LLE and other complexity measures. The most intriguing result was the negative correlation between LLE and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC). The age-related decrease in LLE indicated a higher regularity in dynamics, while the higher LZC indicated a higher randomness in the signal domain. The new findings support the LOCH by demonstrating the simultaneous increase in regularity and randomness.},

The dataset consists of 188 sessions of restingstate eyes-open and eyes-closed recording, taken largely on a weekly basis spanning over six years, albeit with a two-year gap in the midst. Preliminary analyses were done to investigate the age-related changes of conventional spectral characteristics including absolute and relative band power. The results were also compared to a group of older individuals. Through the longitudinal data, we found increased delta, theta, and alpha absolute power with advancing age, with little changes in the higher frequency oscillatory power. Interestingly, these changes in absolute power might indirectly lead to the changes in relative power in other bands (e.g., gamma). Such relationships cannot be derived from the group-level data. Lastly, the individual- and grouplevel data showed opposite findings, suggesting a possibility that the spectral features exhibit nonlinear trajectories in the older age range},

  abstract = {Based on the paradigm by Rilliard et al. we collected audio-visual expressions of attitudes such as arrogance, irony, sincerity and politeness in German. In the experimental design subjects are immersed in sixteen different communicative situations in which they are supposed to portray a certain attitude in a short dialog. Attitudes can be propositional, that is, reactions to a factual situation and/or social, that is, with respect to the relationship with the collocutor. Furthermore, attitudes can be of positive or negative valence or neutral. Undeniably there is a large repertory of subtle differences in the way certain talkers express certain attitudes. The important question is, however, whether collocutors either from the same language or a different one can actually decode these attitudes reliably. On that account we carried out three perceptual experiments in which we presented our recordings of the portrayed attitudes audio-visually, audio-only and video-only. In the first study, German perceivers rated the expressions given the intended attitude, in the second study, they had to choose the most suitable in a choice of five attitudes, and in the third study raters were able to assign freely the term best matching each attitudinal expression. This last experiment was recently replicated by native speakers of Cantonese in Hong Kong. The current article reviews and reevaluates the results from the first three experiments with the German subjects under the premise that perceivers actually have a more limited set of attitudinal registers which they can reliably draw on. This means that expressions can be sorted into a much smaller number of categories than the projected sixteen. In addition we compare and contrast these resulting clusters with the new data from the Cantonese speaking group. Our results indicate indeed a small number of readily decoded attitudes forming four clusters depending on the experiment design - which are also distinct acoustically. Clusters from the statistical analysis are very similar for the German and the Cantonese perceivers and overlap with basic emotions. This result suggests that expressions of attitudes with low identification rates are more complex to decode and require more pragmatic information, that is, more contextual and possibly idiosyncratic information to be interpreted correctly.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The retrogenesis hypothesis proposes that the order of breakdown of cognitive abilities in older adults is the reverse of the developmental order of children. Declarative and procedural memory systems, however, have been empirically understudied regarding this issue. The current study aimed to investigate whether retrogenesis occurs in the developmental and decline order of the declarative and procedural memory systems. Besides, we further investigated whether retrogenesis occurs in declarative memory, which was tested through the recognition of familiar and unfamiliar items. Both questions were investigated by looking at 28 Chinese younger adults and 27 cognitively healthy Chinese older adults. The recognition memory task and the Serial Reaction Time Task were administered on two consecutive days in order to measure their declarative and procedural memory, respectively. The results showed older adults performed significantly worse than younger adults for both tasks on both days, suggesting a decline in both declarative and procedural memory. Moreover, older adults exhibited relatively preserved declarative memory compared to procedural memory. This does not follow the expectations of the retrogenesis hypothesis. However, older adults demonstrated superior performance and a steeper rate of forgetting for recognizing familiar items than unfamiliar items. This reverses the developmental order of different patterns in the declarative memory system. Overall, we conclude that retrogenesis occurs in the declarative memory system, while does not in the decline order of the two memory systems; this understanding can better help inform our broader understanding of memory aging.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
